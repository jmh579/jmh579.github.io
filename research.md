I am interested in international agriculture and rural development with a focus on breeding for improved nutritional quality. I want to empower resource-limited plant breeding programs through the development and deployment of appropriate and user-friendly tools for data capture, storage, and reproducible analyses.

	<h3 class="major">PhenoApps</h3>
	<p>The <a href="https://phenoapps.org">PhenoApps</a> project is focused on the development of Android apps for the efficient collection of plant phenotypes. Our open-source apps are available for free on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=9194692563580469241">Google Play</a> and the source code can be found on <a href="https://github.com/PhenoApps">Github</a>. Throughout the project, I have collaborated closely with <a href="https://www.nextgencassava.org/">Nextgen Cassava</a> to explore the use of low-cost near-infrared spectrometers for quality trait prediction in fresh cassava roots. This work led to the creation of a flexible spectral data analysis pipeline in the form of an R package and <a href="https://www.cassavabase.org/">Cassavabase</a> GUI tool. Our team has also developed an Android app to improve spectrometer workflows for a breeding program context. This project is made possible by NSF-BREAD <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1543958">IOS-1543958</a>.</p>

	<h3 class="major">Sweet corn nutritional quality</h3>
	<p>In 2019, I was awarded a USDA NIFA AFRI EWD Predoctoral fellowship titled <i>Integrating transcriptomics for the improvement of genetic dissection and prediction of provitamin A and vitamin E in fresh sweet corn kernels</i>. Last summer, I grew out a panel of diverse sweet corn inbred lines and harvested fresh kernels for RNA-seq. I am still working my way through the RNA extractions, I but hope to analyze the sequences this fall and use them to study the control of carotenoid and tocochromanol traits through TWAS and transcriptome prediction.</p>

	<h3 class="major">Carrot breeding and genetics</h3>
	<p>During my time in the <a href="https://vcru.wisc.edu/simon/">Simon Lab</a> at UW-Madison, I worked on the first iteration of the USDA NIFA OREI <a href="https://eorganic.info/carrotimprovement/about"><i>Carrot Improvement for Organic Agriculture</i></a> project. I was involved in every stage of the carrot breeding program, from planting and cage building for fly pollination to DNA extraction, HPLC prep, and tissue culture, and loved every part of it. It's safe to say that my experience with the carrot group inspired me to pursue a graduate education in plant breeding and genetics. My family likes to joke that the true start of my career was my (single line) speaking part in a BigTen Network special on breeding carrots for color and flavor. Watch the video below and judge for yourself! &#8681;
